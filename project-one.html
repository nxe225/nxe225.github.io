    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Nyah Espinola. Although I was born in Tucson, Arizona, I am originally from Asuncion, Paraguay. My educational journey took me from elementary school in Paraguay to middle school in Washington, DC, and back to Paraguay for high school. My father is Paraguayan, while my mother is American. I also have an older brother and two dogs: a golden retriever and a boxer.</p>

    <h2>Personal Philosophy & Values</h2>

  <p>My personal philosophy centers on the principles of transparency, mutual respect, and balance, whether in relationships with others or with oneself. I firmly believe that honesty is always the best policy; I would prefer to hear the harsh truth rather than a comforting lie. Respect is crucial, as it forms the foundation for effective communication and meaningful interactions. Additionally, maintaining balance is essentialâ€”striking the right equilibrium between hard work and rest, giving and receiving, ensures a harmonious and fulfilling life.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>My hobbies include traveling, working out, and going to the beach. Exploring new places and indulging in new cultures feeds my soul. Meanwhile, jogging and lifting weights helps me keep my mental and physical health in shape. Finally, the beach is somewhere that I know I can always feel good.</p>
