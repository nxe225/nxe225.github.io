<h2>Rainbow Mountain, Peru</h2>
<p>This unearthly mountain is considered spiritual due to its significance in Andean cosmology, where mountains (apus) are seen as sacred protectors. Its vibrant colors symbolize Pachamama's blessings, representing harmony, abundance, and a connection to nature. The Quechua people view it as a place of powerful energy that bridges the physical and spiritual worlds. It has also been a site for traditional ceremonies honoring Mother Earth and the natural forces of the Andes.</p>
